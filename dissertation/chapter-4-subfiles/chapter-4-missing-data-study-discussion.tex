Our second concern in evaluation of our methods is how performance changes when the data exhibit varying degrees of sparsity. We fix the number of sampled trajectories $N$ and vary $M$, the size of the set  of possible measurement times

\[
t_1,\dots, t_M.
\]
\noindent
We generate irregular data by first generating a complete dataset 

\begin{align*}
Y_1 &= \left(y_1\left(t_1\right), y_1\left(t_2\right), \dots, y_1\left(t_M\right)\right)' \\
Y_2 &= \left(y_2\left(t_1\right), y_2\left(t_2\right), \dots, y_2\left(t_M\right)\right)' \\
&\vdots \\
Y_N &= \left(y_N\left(t_1\right), y_N\left(t_2\right), \dots, y_N\left(t_M\right)\right)',
\end{align*}
\noindent
where $Y_1,\dots, Y_N$ are independently and identically distributed according to an $M$-dimensional multivariate Normal distribution with mean zero and having covariance structure identical to one of Models I - V in \ref{simulation-model-list}. To induce sparsity, we subsample from the complete data $\left\{y_i\left(t_j\right) \right\}$, $i = 1,\dots, N$, $j = 1,\dots, M$, randomly omitting an observation $y_i\left(t_j\right)$ with probability $0.05$, $0.07$, and $0.09$.

Estimated risk under entropy loss is given in Tables~\ref{table:simulation-study-2-entropy-risk-model-1} - \ref{table:simulation-study-2-entropy-risk-model-5}.  Risk estimates under quadratic loss echo in sentiment and are left to the Appendix.  Performance degradation of the estimator in the presence of missing data is highly dependent on the underlying structure of the Cholesky factor of the inverse covariance matrix. For the identity matrix and for the non-truncated linear varying coefficient GARP model, we observe little change in estimated entropy risk for within subject sample sizes $M = 10$ and $M = 20$ with downsampling as compared to the estimated risk for both sample sizes in the complete data case.  Neither model selection criteria appear to perform better than the other, which suggests that when the estimated innovation variances are close to the true variances of the prediction residuals, using the unbiased risk estimate with the working residuals as substitute for the relative error is a reasonable approach to modeling. When the data are missing completely at random, the performance of the estimator remains fairly stable when 5\%, 7\%, and 9\% of the data are missing.
