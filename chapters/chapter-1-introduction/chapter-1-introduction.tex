\begin{abstract}
With high dimensional longitudinal and functional data becoming much more common, there is a strong need for methods of estimating large covariance matrices. Estimation is made difficult  by the instability of sample covariance matrices in high dimensions and a positive-definite constraint we desire to impose on estimates. A Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix allows for parameter estimation via unconstrained optimization as well as a statistically meaningful interpretation of the parameter estimates. Regularization improves stability of covariance estimates in high dimensions, as well as in the case where functional data are sparse and individual curves are sampled at different and possibly unequally spaced time points. By viewing the entries of the covariance matrix as the evaluation of a continuous bivariate function at the pairs of observed time points, we treat covariance estimation as bivariate smoothing. 

\bigskip

Within regularization framework, we propose novel covariance penalties which are designed to yield natural null models presented in the literature for stationarity or short-term dependence. These penalties are expressed in terms of variation in continuous time lag and its orthogonal complement. We present numerical results and data analysis to illustrate the utility of the proposed method. \\

\section{Covariance estimation: a review}


\bigskip

Estimation of the covariance matrix is fundamental to the analysis of multivariate data, and the most commonly used estimator is the sample covariance matrix, $S$. While it is both positive-definite and an unbiased estimator of $\Sigma$, it is unstable large dimension $M$. Approaches rooted in decision theory yield stable estimators which are scalar multiples of the sample covariance matrix; these estimators distort the eigenstructure of $\Sigma$ unless the sample size is greater than the dimension, $N >> M$ (\citet{dempster1972covariance}.)  There is a vast body of work which addresses the efficient estimation of the covariance matrix of a normal distribution by correcting the eigenstructure distortion or reducing the number of parameters to be estimated. See \citet{stein1975estimation}, \citet{lin1985monte}, \citet{yang1994estimation}, \citet{daniels1999nonconjugate}, \citet{champion2003empirical} 

\bigskip

The sample covariance matrix $S$, which is used in virtually all multivariate techniques, is both unbiased and positive-definite. The flexible estimator is also computationally convenient, however it is neither parsimonious nor, in high dimensions, a stable estimator. Given a sample of size $N$ $Y_1,\dots , Y_N$, from an $M$-dimensional Normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and covariance matrix $\Sigma$, the sample covariance matrix

\begin{equation} \label{eq:sample-covariance-matrix}
S = \left(N-1\right)^{-1} \sum_{i = 1}^N \left(Y_i - \bar{Y}\right)\left(Y_i - \bar{Y}\right)'
\end{equation}
\noindent
is a straightforward estimator of the $\frac{M\left(M+1\right)}{2}$ parameters of the unstructured covariance matrix $\Sigma$. The number of parameters of $\Sigma = \left( \sigma_{ij} \right)$ grows quadratically in the dimension $M$, and the parameters must satisfy the positive-definiteness constraint

\begin{equation} \label{eq:positive-definite-constraint} 
v'\Sigma v = \sum_{i,j = 1}^M v_i v_j \sigma_{ij} \ge 0 
\end{equation}
\noindent
for all $v \in \Re^M$. The challenge presented by these hurdles have motivated a growing body of research in statistics and its areas of application aimed at effectively estimating covariance matrices.

\bigskip

Our review of work in this area focuses on developments made from two connected perspectives: regularization or sparsity in covariance matrices for high-dimensional data, and generalized linear models (GLM) or parsimony and use of covariates in low dimensions. A recurring technique in both perspectives is the reduction of covariance estimation to estimating a single of sequence of regression. The generalized linear model (GLM) framework \citet{McCullagh1989} merges numerous seemingly disconnected approaches to model the mean of a distribution, and can accommodate many types of including normal, probit, logistic and Poisson regressions, survival data, and log-linear models for contingency tables. The key to the power of the GLM paradigm is the use of a link function to induce unconstrained reparameterization for the mean of a distribution, and hence the ability to reduce the dimension of the parameter space via modeling the covariate effect additively by increasing the number of parameters gradually one at a time corresponding to inclusion of each covariate. The extension of the GLM has lead to large class of models including nonparametric and generalized additive models, Bayesian GLM, and generalized linear mixed models. See \citet{hastie1990generalized},  \citet{dey2000generalized},  \citet{mcculloch2001generalized}. An analogous framework for modeling covariance matrices facilitates further developments in covariance estimation from the Bayesian, nonparametric and other paradigms.

\subsubsection{Elementwise shrinkage} \label{subsubsection:chapter-1-sss-1-3-4}
A broad class of estimators that aim to stabilize the sample covariance matrix do so by applying shrinkage elementwise to the same covariance matrix. Shrinking the elements of the sample covariance matrix has been approached in a multitude of ways, including banding, tapering, and thresholding. These estimators are computationally inexpensive, with the exception of cross validation necessary for smoothing parameter selection. The tradeoff accompanying the ease of computation is that, because transformations of sample estimates are elementwise, the resulting estimators are not guaranteed to be positive definite.

\subsubsection{thresholding the sample covariance matrix}

\subfile{chapter-1-subfiles/chapter-1-thresholding-estimators}

\bigskip

Alternately, for estimating the covariance of a random vector which is assumed to have a natural (time) ordering, several have proposed applying kernel smoothing methods directly to elements of the sample covariance matrix or a function of the sample covariance matrix. \citet{zeger1994semiparametric} introduced a nonparametric estimator obtained by kernel smoothing the sample variogram and squared residuals.  \citet{yao2005functional} applied a local linear smoother to the sample covariance matrix in the direction of the diagonal and a local quadratic smoother in the direction orthogonal to the diagonal to account for the presence of additional variation due to measurement error. The latter work is one of the few nonparametric methods utilizing smoothing in both dimensions of the covariance matrix, which was an inspiration of sorts for the work we present in Chapter 2. Like other elementwise shrinkage estimators, however, their proposed estimator is not guaranteed to be positive definite. 

\subsubsection{Tuning parameter selection for element-wise shrinkage estimators}

The performance of any regularized estimator depends heavily on the quality of tuning parameter selection. The Frobenius is a natural measure of the accuracy of an estimator; it quantifies the sum over the unique elements of $\Sigma$ of the the first term in \ref{eq:general-thresholding-objective-function}, 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:forbenius-norm}
\vert \vert  \hat{\Sigma}^\lambda - \Sigma \vert \vert^2 = \left(\sum_{i,j} \left(\hat{\sigma}^\lambda_{ij} - \sigma_{ij} \right)^2\right)^{1/2}
\end{equation}
\noindent
If $\Sigma$ were available, one would choose the value of the tuning parameter $\lambda$ which minimizes \ref{eq:frobenius-norm}. In practice, one tries to first approximate the risk, or 
\[
E_\Sigma\left[\vert \vert  \hat{\Sigma}^\lambda - \Sigma \vert \vert^2 \right],
\]
\noindent
and then choose the optimal value of $\lambda$.  As in regression methods, cross validation and a number of its variants have become popular choices for tuning parameter selection in covariance estimation, though unanimous agreement on which precise procedure is optimal is fleeting.  $K$-fold cross validation requires first splitting the data into folds $\mathcal{D}_1, \mathcal{D}_2, \dots, \mathcal{D}_K$. The value of the tuning parameter is selected to minimize

\begin{equation} \label{eq:K-fold-matrix--cv}
\mbox{CV}_F\left(\lambda \right) = \argmin{\lambda} K^{-1} \sum_{k = 1}^K  \vert \vert\hat{\Sigma}^{\left(-k\right)} - \tilde{\Sigma}^{\left(k\right)}  \vert \vert_F^2, 
\end{equation}
\noindent
where $\tilde{\Sigma}^{\left(k\right)}$ is the unregularized estimator based on based on $\mathcal{D}_k$, and $\hat{\Sigma}^{\left(-k\right)}$ is the regularized estimator under consideration based on the data after holding $\mathcal{D}_k$ out.  Using this approach, the size of the training data set is approximately $\left(K - 1 \right)N/K$, and the size of the validation set is approximately $N/K$ (though these quantities are only relevant when subjects have equal numbers of observations). For linear models, it has been shown that cross validation is asymptotically consistent is the ratio of the validation data set size over the training set size goes to 1. See \citet{shao1993linear}. This result motivates the reverse cross validation criterion, which is defined as follows:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:K-fold-matrix-reverse-cv}
\mbox{rCV}_F\left(\lambda \right) = \argmin{\lambda} K^{-1} \sum_{k = 1}^K  \vert \vert\hat{\Sigma}^{\left(k\right)} - \tilde{\Sigma}^{\left(-k\right)}  \vert \vert_F^2, 
\end{equation}
\noindent
where $\tilde{\Sigma}^{\left(-k\right)}$ is the unregularized estimator based on based on the data after holding out $\mathcal{D}_k$, and $\hat{\Sigma}^{\left(k\right)}$ is the regularized estimator under consideration based on $\mathcal{D}_k$.

\subsection{Matrix decompositions} \label{chapter-1-matrix-decompositions}
The most methodic and successful approaches to covariance modeling is to decompose the covariance matrix into its variance and dependence components. The following section demonstrates the role of multiple matrix parameterizations in removing the positive definite constraint that poses a challenge in most covariance estimation settings.

%We adopt the approach based on the Cholesky decomposition. The modified Cholesky decomposition (MCD) has received much attention in the covariance estimation literature, as it ensures positive-definite covariance estimates, and, unlike the spectral decomposition whose parameters follow an orthogonality constraint, the Cholesky decomposition are unconstrained and have an attractive statistical interpretation as particular regression coefficients and variances.  
%{\needsparaphrased{The Cholesky decomposition is similar to the spectral decomposition in that  is diagonalized by a lower triangular matrix T: 
%
%\[
%T \Sigma T' = D,
%\]
%where the nonredundant entries of T are unconstrained and more meaningful statistically than those of the orthogonal matrix of the spectral decomposition. The matrix T is constructed from the regression coefficients when yt is regressed on its predecessors:
%
%\begin{equation}
%y_t = \sum_{j = 1}^{t-1} \phi_{t,j} y_j + \epsilon_t,
%\end{equation}
%\noindent
%where the $\left(t, j\right)$ entry of $T$ is $\phi_{tj}$ , the negatives of the regression coefficients and the $(t, t)$ entry of $D$ is $\sigma_t^2 = var\left(\epsilon_t\right)$, the innovation variance. A schematic view of the components of a covariance matrix obtained through successive regressions (Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure) is given in Table 2. Since the $\phi_{ij}$s are regression coefficients, it is evident that for any unstructured covariance matrix these and the log innovation variances are unconstrained, in the sequel they are referred to as the generalized autoregressive parameters (GARP) and innovation variances (IV) of Y or ? (Pourahmadi, 1999, 2000). Interestingly, this regression approach reveals the equivalence of modeling a covariance matrix to that of dealing with a sequence of $p - 1$ varying-coefficient and varying-order regression models. Consequently, one can bring the entire regression machinery to the service of the unintuitive task of modeling covariance matrices. Stated differently, the framework above is similar to that of using increasing order autoregressive models in approximating the covariance matrix or the spectrum of a stationary time series.}}
%
%The covariance matrix $\Sigma$ of a zero-mean random vector $Y = \left(y_1, \dots , y_m\right)'$ has the following unique modified Cholesky decomposition (Newton, 1988)
%
%\begin{equation} \label{eq:cholesky-matrix-decomposition}
%T \Sigma T' = D, 
%\end{equation}
%
%where $T$ is a lower triangular matrix with $1$?s as its diagonal entries and $D = \mbox{diag}\left(\sigma_1^2, \dots , \sigma_m^2\right)$ is a diagonal matrix. An attractive feature of this decomposition is that unlike the entries of $\Sigma$, the subdiagonal entries of $T$ and the log of the diagonal elements of $D$, $\log\left( \sigma_m^2 \right)$, $t = 1, \dots , m$, are not constrained. This permits one to impose structures on the unconstrained parameters without worrying about the resulting estimator not satisfying the positive-definiteness constraint. Denote estimators of $T$ and $D$ in \ref{eq:T-Sigma-Ttrans-equals-D} by  $\hat{T}$ and $\hat{D}$, which may be obtained by fitting linear models or some other structural models; then an estimator of $\Sigma$ given by $\Sigma  = \hat{T}^{-T} \hat{D} \hat{T}^{-T}$ is guaranteed to be positive-definite.  From this perspective, covariance modeling can be considered an extension of generalized linear models \citet{McCullagh1989}. Factoring $\Sigma$ as in \ref{eq:cholesky-matrix-decomposition} provides a link function $g\left(\Sigma\right) = \left(T, \log\left(D\right)\right)$ where $\log\left(D\right) = \mbox{diag}\left( \log\left(\sigma_1^2\right),\dots , \log\left(\sigma_m^2 \right) \right)$. Parametric, nonparametric, or  Bayesian models may then be applied to  the unconstrained entries of $T$ and $\log\left(D\right)$.  Whereas other decompositions are permutation-invariant, the interpretation of  the regression model induced by the MCD assumes a natural (time) ordering among the variables in $Y$.
%
%\bigskip
%
%{\needsparaphrased{immediately leads to the modified Cholesky decomposition \ref{eq:cholesky-matrix-decomposition}. It also can be used to clarify the close relation between the decomposition (2) and the time series ARMA models in that the latter is means to diagonalize a Toeplitz covariance matrix, for details see Pourahmadi (2001, Sec. 4.2.5).
%
%
%
%\needsparaphrased{In sharp contrast, the fact that the lower triangular matrix $T$ in the Cholesky decomposition of a covariance matrix $\Sigma$ is unconstrained makes it ideal for nonparametric estimation.
%Wu and Pourahmadi (2003) have used local polynomial estimators to smooth the subdiagonals of $T$. For the moment, denoting such estimators of $T$ and $D$ in (2) by $T$ and $D$, an
%estimator of $\Sigma$ given by $\Sigma = \hat{T}^{-1}D{\hat{T}^{-1}}^{\prime}$ is guaranteed to be positive-definite. Although one could smooth rows and columns of $T$,  the idea of smoothing along its subdiagonals is motivated by the similarity of the regressions in (3) to the varying-coefficients autoregressions (Kitagawa and Gersch, 1985, 1996; Dahlhaus, 1997): Xm

%\begin{equation}
%f_{j,p}\left(t/p\right)y_{t_j} = \sigma_p\left(t/p\right)\epsilon_t, \quad t = 0, 1, 2, \dots, M,
%\end{equation}
%\noindent
%where $f_{0,p}\left(�\right) = 1$, $f_{j,p}\left(�\right)$, 1 ? j ? m, and ?p(�) are continuous functions on $\left[0, 1\right]$ and {?t}
%30 is a sequence of independent random variables each with mean zero and variance one. This analogy and comparison with the matrix $T$ for stationary autoregressions having constant
%entries along subdiagonals suggest taking the subdiagonals of $T$ to be realizations of some smooth univariate functions:
%
%\begin{equation*}
%\phi_{t,t-j} = f_{j,M}\left(t/M\right),\quad \sigma_t + \sigma_M \left(t/M\right). 
%\end{equation*}
%
%The details of smoothing and selection of the order $m$ of the autoregression and a simulation study comparing performance of the sample covariance matrix to smoothed estimators are given in Wu and Pourahmadi (2003). Due to the closer connection between entries of $T$ and the family of regression (3), it is conceivable that some of the entries of $T$ could be zero or close to it. Smith and Kohn (2002) have used a prior that allows for zero entries in $T$ and have obtained a parsimonious model for $\Sigma$ without assuming a parametric structure. Similar results are reported in Huang, Liu and Pourahmadi (2004) using penalized likelihood with $L_1$-penalty to estimate $T$ for Gaussian data.}
% A commonly utilized approach in previous work is to model $\phi_{ijk} = z_{ijk}^T \gamma$ where $z_{ijk}$ is a vector of powers of time differences and $\gamma$ is a vector of unknown ``dependence'' parameters to be estimated from the data. \citet{chen2011efficient}, \citet{lin2009robust}, \citet{pan2003modelling},  and \citet{pourahmadi1999joint} define
%
%\begin{equation}
%z_{ijk}^T = \left(1, t_{ij} - t_{ik},\left( t_{ij} - t_{ik} \right)^2, \dots, \left(t_{ij} - t_{ik}\right)^{q-1} \right) \label{covmodel}
%\end{equation}
%
%Modeling the covariance in such a way is reduces a potentially high dimensional problem to something much more computationally feasible; if one models the innovation variances $\sigma^2\left(t\right)$ similarly using a $d$-dimensional vector of covariates, the problem reduces to estimating $q+d$ unconstrained parameters, where much of the dimensionality reduction is a result of characterizing the GARPs in terms of only the difference between pairs of observed time points, and not the time points themselves.  Modeling $\phi$ in such a way is equivalent to specifying a Toeplitz structure for $\Sigma$. A $p \times p$ Toeplitz matrix $M$ is a matrix with elements $m_{ij}$ such that $m_{ij} = m_{\vert i-j \vert}$ i.e. a matrix of the form
%
%
%\bigskip
%
%The estimated covariance matrix may be considerably biased when the specified parametric model is far from the truth.  To avoid model misspecification that potentially accompanies parametric analysis, many have alternatively  proposed nonparametric and semiparametric techniques approaches to estimation.  While these estimators can be very flexible and thus exhibit low bias, this advantage can be offset with high variance.  To balance the tradeoff between bias and variance, shrinkage or regularization may be applied to estimates to improve stability of estimators. \citet{diggle1998nonparametric} proposed nonparametric estimation of the covariance matrix of longitudinal data by smoothing raw sample variogram ordinates and squared residuals.  [DISCUSS THE NONPARAMETRIC SMOOTHER OF HANS GEORG MULLER HERE]  However, neither of these methods ensure that the resulting estimates are positive-definite.  
%
%\bigskip
%Several others have proposed methods for covariance estimation within the same paradigm of a smooth, continuous function underlying a discretized covariance matrix associated with the observed data.   \citet{pourahmadi1999joint} employ the Cholesky decomposition to guarantee positive-definiteness and imposed structure on the elements of the Cholesky decomposition and heuristically argue that $\phi_{t,t-l}$ should be monotonically decreasing in $l$. That is, the effect of $y_{t-l}$ on $y_t$ through the autoregressive parameterization should decrease as the distance in time between the two measurements increases. In similar spirit, others including \citet{bickel2008regularized} and \citet{levina2008sparse} enforce such structure by setting $\phi_{t,t-l}$ equal to zero for $l$ large enough, or equivalently, setting all subdiagonals of $T$ to zero beyond the $K^{th}$ off-diagonal. The tuning parameter $K$ is chosen using a model selection criterion such as Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, or cross validation or a variant thereof.  In terms of the autoregressive model corresponding to the Cholesky decomposition, this form of regularization, known as ``banding'' the Cholesky factor $T$, is equivalent to regressing $y_t$ on only its $K$ immediate predecessors, setting $\phi_{tj} = 0$ for $t-j>K$. 
%
%\bigskip
%
%From this perspective, it is apparent that the presentation of covariance estimation as a least squares regression problem suggests that the familiar ideas of model regularization for least-squares regression can be used for estimating covariances.  . \citet{huang2007estimation} 
%
%however, their two-step method did not utilize the information that many of the subdiagonals of T are essentially zeros at the first step. Inefficient estimation may result because of ignoring regularization structure in constructing the raw estimator. 
%
%\bigskip
%
%Several have applied these approaches to covariance estimation; 
%\bigskip
%
%Alternatively, one can view $T$ as a bivariate function,
%
%Several others have considered this approach to covariance estimation; \citet{kaufman2008covariance} assume a stationary process, restricting covariance estimates to a specific class of functions.  They as well as  Huang, Liu, and Liu \citet{huang2007estimation} follow the hueristic argument presented by \citet{pourahmadi1999joint} that $\phi_{t,t-l}$ is monotone decreasing in $l$ and set off-diagonal elements of either the covariance matrix or the Cholesky factor corresponding to large lags to zero.   As in \citet{huang2007estimation}, \citet{kaufman2008covariance}, and \citet{yao2005functional}, we treat covariance estimation as a function estimation problem where the covariance matrix is viewed as the evaluation of a smooth function at particular design points. 
%
%including \citet{bickel2008regularized} and \citet{huang2006covariance}  have proposed nonparametric estimators of a specific covariance matrix (or its inverse) rather than the parameters of a covariance function. 
%
%\bigskip
%
%\citet{yao2005functional} do not utilize the Cholesky parameterization, and their estimates are not guaranteed to be positive definite.  We combine the advantages of bivariate smoothing as in \citet{yao2005functional} with the added utility of the Cholesky parameterization in \citet{huang2007estimation}; in doing so, we present a flexible and coherent approach to covariance estimation, while simultaneously we ensuring positive definiteness of estimates.Rather than shrinking element of the Cholesky factor to zero after a particular value of $l$, we choose to softly enforce monotonicity in $l$ by using a hinge penalty as in the work of \citet{tibshirani2011nearly}. 
%
%\section{The Cholesky Decomposition and the MLE for $\Sigma$}
%
%Let $Y = \left( y_{1}, y_{2}, \dots, y_{m} \right)'$ denote a mean zero random vector with variance-covariance matrix $\Sigma$, which we can think of as the time-ordered measurements on one subject in a longitudinal study. To present a comprehensive overview our estimation procedure, we begin with the representation of the covariance matrix, $\Sigma$, in terms of its Cholesky decomposition. Decomposing $\Sigma$ in such a way allows for both an unconstrained parameterization and statistically meaningful interpretation of covariance parameters. For any positive definite matrix $\Sigma$, there exists a unique lower triangular matrix $T$ with diagonal entries equal to $1$ which diagonalizes $\Sigma$:
%
%\begin{equation} \label{eq:T-Sigma-Ttrans-equals-D}
% T \Sigma T^T = D
%\end{equation}
%\noindent
%
%The convenient statistical interpretation of the parameters of the covariance matrix then comes if we consider, for $t = 2, \dots, m$, regressing $y_t$ on its predecessors $y_1,\dots, y_{t-1}$, letting
%\begin{equation} 
%{y}_{i}  = \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} \phi_{ij} y_{j} + \sigma_{i}\epsilon_{i} \label{eq:discrete-evenly-spaced-ar-model},
%\end{equation}
%\noindent
%where $\mbox{var}\left( \epsilon_i \right) = \sigma_i^2$. If we take the $i$-$j^{th}$ element $T$ to be $-\phi_{ij}$ for $j < i$, and take the $i^{th}$ diagonal entry of $D$ to be $\mbox{var}\left( \epsilon_i \right) = \sigma_i^2$, a vectorized expression for Model~\ref{eq:discrete-evenly-spaced-ar-model} is given by
%
%\begin{equation}
%\bfeps = T Y \label{eq:vectorized-ar-model}.
%\end{equation}

%and taking covariances on both sides of \eqref{epsilon}, we see that $T$ and $D$ satisfy \ref{eq:T-Sigma-Ttrans-equals-D}. Immediately, we have that $\Sigma^{-1} = T' D^{-1} T$. The regression coefficients $\lbrace \phi_{ij} \rbrace$ are referred to as the \emph{generalized autoregressive parameters} (GARPs), and the $\lbrace \sigma_{ij} \rbrace$ are referred to as the \emph{innovation variances} (IVs.)

%Assuming that $Y$ follows a multivariate normal distribution, the loglikelihood function $\ell \left( Y, \Sigma \right)$ satisfies
%
%\begin{equation} \label{eq:loglik-general-form}
%-2\ell\left( Y, \Sigma \right) = \log \vert \Sigma \vert + Y' \Sigma Y
%\end{equation}
%\noindent
%From \ref{eq:T-Sigma-Ttrans-equals-D}, we have that 
%\[
%\vert \Sigma\vert = \vert D \vert = \prod_{i = 1}^m \sigma_i^2
%\]
%and 
%\[
%\Sigma^{-1} = T' D^{-1} T.
%\]
%Thus, \ref{eq:loglik-general-form} can be written in terms of the prediction errors and their variances of the non-redundant entries of $\left(T , D\right)$:
%
%\begin{align}
%\begin{split} \label{eq:loglik-cholesky-form}
%-2\ell\left( Y, \Sigma \right) &= \log \vert D \vert + Y' T' D^{-1} T Y \\
%&= \sum_{i = 1}^m \log \sigma_i^2  + \sum_{i = 1}^m \frac {\epsilon_i^2}{\sigma_i^2},
%\end{split}
%\end{align}
%\noindent
%where $\epsilon_1 = y_1$ and $\epsilon_i = y_i - \sum_{j = 1}^{i-1} \phi_{ij} y_j$. Maximum likelihood estimation or any of its penalized variants may then be employed to obtain estimates of $T$ and $D$.

%Unlike many of those before who have used the Cholesky decomposition as a means of modeling $\Sigma$, we allow observed time points to be individual-specific and not necessarily regularly spaced.  Let $Y_1, \dots, Y_N$ denote a random sample of mean zero vectors of longitudinal measurements taken on $N$ subjects having common covariance structure $\Sigma$.  We allow subject $i$ to have observation vector $y_i = \left(y_{i1} ,\dots , y_{i,m_i}\right)'$ with corresponding vector of observation times $\left(t_{i1} ,\dots , t_{i,m_i}\right)'$.  Accommodating the subject-specific sample sizes and measurement times requires merely adding a subscript, and Model \ref{eq:discrete-evenly-spaced-ar-model} becomes 
%
%\begin{equation}
%{y}_{ij}  = \sum_{k=1}^{j-1} \phi_{ijk} y_{ik} + \sigma_{ij}\epsilon_{ij}, \label{eq:discrete-unevenly-spaced-ar-model}
%\end{equation}
%\noindent
%where $\phi_{ijk}$ is the autoregressive coefficient corresponding to the pair of measurements observed at time $t_{ij}$ and $t_{ik}$. A vectorized representation of Model~\ref{eq:discrete-unevenly-spaced-ar-model} can be obtained as before by adding the necessary parameters to $T$ and $D$.

Modeling $\phi_{ij} = \phi\left(t_i, t_j\right)$ as a smooth bivariate function, we cast the problem of estimating a covariance matrix as the estimation of a functional varying coefficient model. The existing body of literature surrounding these models is an extensive one; see \citet{csenturk2008generalized}, \citet{csenturk2013modeling}, and \citet{noh2010sparse}. This class of models is both flexible and interpretable, making them a pragmatic modeling choice when understanding the underlying data generating mechanism is of as much importance as strong predictive capability. We employ two representations of the GARPs, which we refer to as the \textit{generalized autoregressive coefficient function} within this frame. Chapter 2 presents a reproducing kernel Hilbert space framework for the estimation of both $\phi$ and $\sigma^2$. In Chapter 3, we discuss an alternative representation the varying coefficient function using the penalized B-splines of \citet{eilers1996flexible}. We properties of the P-splines that establish their connection to the usual spline penalty on the second derivative and demonstrate how their simple construction allows for extremely flexible regularization.
