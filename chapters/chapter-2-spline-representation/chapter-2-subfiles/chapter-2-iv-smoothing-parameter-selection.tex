The gamma penalized log likelihood (\ref{eq:form-of-smoothing-spline-solution-kappa}) is non-quadratic, so $\kappa_\lambda$ must be computed using iteration even for fixed smoothing parameter. Performance-oriented iteration and generalized approximate cross validation (GACV) are the most common approaches to selecting the smoothing parameter for penalized regression with exponential families. As in our discussion of model selection for $\phi$, we omit dependence of any components on the $\theta_\beta$ and only explicitly express dependence on smoothing parameters through $\lambda$.

\subsubsection{Performance-oriented iteration} 

A measure of the discrepancy between distributions belonging to an exponential family is the Kullback-Leibler distance
